Algorithms Questions
====================

Most of this is stolen from [here](https://www.palantir.com/2011/09/how-to-ace-an-algorithms-interview/)

Starting off

1. Understand the problem
2. Get something out there
  * acts as a warmup
  * confidence booster

Ok I have something, now what?

Well you give a better answer this time.

What if I'm stuck?

The worst thing you can do here is nothing. Writing
pictures/pseudo-code is often helpful in leading to
an insight and also shows the interviewer your thought
process.

Think about general algorithm abstractions/patterns

  * greedy
  * dynamic programming
  * divide and conquer
  * hash tables
  * sorting
  * binary search
  * recursion

No matter the problem you're going to need data structures.
So think about which ones you might need.

If a problem requires sorting, often following this with a BST
will be a solid approach.

More importantly though start off by thinking about the characteristics
of the operations on the data.

  * Inserts
  * Deletes
  * Lookups

Think about related problems. Try to find a pattern or approach that this
problem might fall under. Do *NOT* try relate it very deeply to a specific problem
as this will most likely lead to tunnel vision.

Breaking down the problem into parts is often helpful. Remember the algorithm
is by definition a sequence of steps(computations). It's really hard to think
of the entire algorithm at once. The bird by bird approach is often best.

Don't be afraid to backtrack! This can be huge sometimes you just
need to fresh approach.
