DP ~= careful brute force

DP ~= guessing + recursion + memoization

DP ~= dividing into reasonable # subproblems whose solutions relate to the guessing part of the solution

time = # subproblems x time/subproblem

## 5 Easy Steps to Dynamic Programming

1. define subproblems (count # subproblems)
2. guess (count # choices)
3. relate subproblem solutions
4. recurse + memoization OR build a DP table bottom-up
5. solve original problem
