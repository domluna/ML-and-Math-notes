Turing Machines
---------------

### Definition

TM is described as:
1. set of states
2. input alphabet
3. tape alphabet (includes blanks)
4. transition function
5. accept/reject states
6. starting state

### Equivalence

A single tape TM is equiv to a multi tape TM is equiv to a non-deterministic TM.

### Recognize

TM can regonize a language A if TM accepts/reject/loops forever

### Decidability

TM can decide a language A if TM reaches an accept/reject state
