Groups
------

Def: A group G = (S, .), S is a set and is a binary op (.), a function
mapping pairs of group elements to group elements, with the following properties.

1. There exists an identity element (e) in the Set, s.t : e.x = x.e = x for all x
in S
2. For all elements x in S, there exists an inverse element x-inv in S s.t 
x-inv.x = x.x-inv = e
3. The operation (.) is associative. That is, (a.b).c = a.(b.c) for all a,b,c in S

In order words: associativity, identity and invertibility.
