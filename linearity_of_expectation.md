Linearity of Expectation
========================

It's actually pretty elegant and straightforward

g(X) is some function, X is some random variable.

E[g(X)] /= g(E[X]) in general.

An exception to this rule is with linear functions.

If g(x) is of the form: ax + b

then

E[g(X)] = g(E[X])

and that is the linearity of expectation.
