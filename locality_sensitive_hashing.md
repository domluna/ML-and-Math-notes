Locality Sensitive Hashing

Contrary to crypto hashing in which the avalanche effect is crucial
to security.

Avalanche effect - If the input changes slightly the output hash
should be at least 50% different.

With LSH we wish to have the property which similar things have similar hashes.
This is useful when comparing data that would otherwise to be expensive to check
in its original form.
