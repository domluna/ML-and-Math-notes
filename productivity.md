# Being More Productive? :)

Read. Reading gives you perspective. There's the famous saying, "A person who
has read 1000 books has lived 1000 lives."

Brain's peak performance is 2-4 hours after you wake up.
If you wake up at 5am, then from 7-9 your brain is at its
most productive.

Hack. Meditation can be give you deeper rest than sleep.
So at some midway point in your day meditate and then you can
get 2 more hours of peak brain performance. 

You can also do short naps, but meditation is a far superior choice here.

No news. This is about being *active* vs. *reactive*. News makes
us reactive. It adds things to our todo list. Often these things
are small wins as well so it gives you a false sense of productivity.

If you know all the current things/events going on then chances are, unless that's
your job, you're not being productive.

Limit email to checking it 1-2 times per day at most. Emails are by nature not something
you have a respond it to instantly. It provides the same functionality real mail did. 
It's just faster.

A time limit on email could also be good. Ex. For the the next 30 mins I'll do email stuff.
This means for the rest of the day you don't do email stuff. NOTE: This doesn't mean you have
a 30 min allowance for the day, then you'll just check email for a few seconds every 30 mins or so.

Think of obstacles as a challenge to better yourself, to improve.
